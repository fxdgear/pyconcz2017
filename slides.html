# Well what is Tox anyway?

Tox is a great tool for allowing testing your code
against a varaity of different Python interpeters.


---

# What is Tox good for?

* Say you have this great 3rd party Django app.
* You do you development in a virtual env.
* You use the latest version of Python.
* You write your tests.
* You publish your app on PyPI.

Everything is great!

---

# First Bug

Your app doesn't work with X version of Django

Easy,

1. create a new venv
2. install X version of Django
3. run tests
4. debug
5. fix
6. publish

---

# Second Bug

Your app doesn't work with Y version of Python.

First you have to install Y version of Python
and create a new venv and repeat the steps from before.

---

# New Feature

Now you want to make a new feature. And now you have to make sure
your code works in 3 different virtual envs.

---
# And so on...

I'm sure you can see where this is going now...

---

# Enter Tox

Tox allows you to create a single file which will dynamically create venvs for you
will run your tests across all the different permuations you can think of.

```
# content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py
[tox]
envlist = py26,py27
[testenv]
deps=pytest # or 'nose' or ...
commands=py.test  # or 'nosetests' or ...
```

---

# Problem solved?

This is where most people stop. But not you. You're here cause you want more!

---

# Problems

Tox requires that you have all the different versions of python installed.

* python 2.6
* python 2.7
* python 3.3
* python 3.4
* python 3.5
* python 3.6
* python 3.7
* jython
* pypy
* pypy3

---

# Portaility

Virtual envs are not easily portable.

While it is possible to take one virtual env and transfer it to a different machine
it is not very easy.

Also you will have to install each version of python on each machine you want to transfer
the venv too.

---

# Parallelism

Tox is not a parallelizable solution. The more permuations you have in your test matrix
the longer your test matrix will take.

---

# Real backends

Using Tox against a varaity of backends (mysql, postgres, SQLServer, etc...) will require
that each of these backends be installed.

Do you really want to install SQLServer on your computer? Eww

---

# Versions...

Lets not forget that each of these backends have different versions too...

---

# Recap

We have lets say:

* 10 versions of python
* 7 versions of Django
* 3 different database backends

10 * 7 * 3 = 210 different tests to run

Also lets say our tests are fast and complete in 1 minute.

This will take tox 3.5 hours to complete.

Who has time for this?

---

# Docker to the rescue

By using Docker we can

1. parallize the execution of the tests
2. make our test environment portable
3. smaller install footprint
4. easily run a subset of the tests


---
# Trade Offs

To do our stuff in docker there exists a few trade offs...

---

# Setup Tradeoff

Each element in our test matrix requires a different Dockerfile.

The good news is that all the dockerfiles are basically the same. Just with
different `FROM` statements.

We are programmers this can be solved using a templeting library.

---

# Output Tradeoff

Since the tests are run in parallel it's hard to view the test results in the console.

We'll have to use Docker's built in logging to view the logs that come from each
test matrix element.

---

# Install Tradeoff

Docker and Docker Compost will need to be installed vs each
